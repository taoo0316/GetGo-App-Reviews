592,2022-11-15 16:04:06,,"I was an avid user of GetGo and used it often (up to several times a week).

I was charged for alleged vehicle damage  on 10 Oct 2022 and my GetGo account access has been locked.

It was a shock when I was suddenly invoiced for this big sum out of the blue, when I have never been in an accident before during my numerous times driving with GetGo. I am not the one responsible for the repairs GetGo has made on the damaged vehicle.

I usually take photos of each GetGo car before use and retain it for at least 2 weeks. But given the high frequency of my GetGo rentals at the time, I am not able to recall if I performed a thorough check of the GetGo car that day. I have tried searching for photos of that car but unfortunately could have already deleted photos if any due to my usual habit of deleting photos frequently to free up phone space. At every step of the dispute process (and even in prior communications with GetGo), I have done my best to cooperate with GetGo staff and respond to their requests. Regrettably, I missed one email and thereafter was invoiced without any warning, which came as a shock.

Please share if GetGo has any proof that I damaged the car and it was not damaged by others using the car before/after me or at the carpark? Does GetGo have full confidence on this matter, when in fact one of your emails (sent 9 Nov) said ""Can I check with you whether is the damage caused by you as you reported the damages in between your booking. We will need the timestamp photo that the damage of the vehicle existed before your booking."" 

I am extremely unhappy about this situation due to my inability to speak with GetGo staff over the phone/in-person to work out this dispute, instead forcing me to endure an emotional afternoon of trying to clarify the situation while I was still at the office working. Despite this, I genuinely hope to continue my usage of GetGo in future as it has been a positive experience using the app thus far until this incident occurred.

For next steps, I hope that GetGo will contact me  for further discussion and resolve the issue, and minimally perform a full investigation and provide proof of my role in damaging the car. Additionally, I would be willing to cooperate/lodge police report for a full investigation on this matter, as SGD 1,203 is a significant amount, so please let me know if I am able to help in this matter.",1,False,Accused and false charges,Cable joseph

However, it‚Äôs an additional layer of protection meant to safeguard users from fraudulent account creation and unauthorised usage. The changing of mobile numbers was one of the most common trends observed in cases of fraudulent account use, which is why we now require user selfies with their licence for verification. This additional step gives us greater confidence that the request is coming from the account owner. \n\nThank you for your understanding and we hope that you‚Äôll give GetGo another try soon.

Hello, change of phone number need selfie with driving license? I send from my registered email address + provide my personal info not enough?! Not a Govt agency and want to ask more than Govt requires for a phone number change? If change address how? Tell me how about address change? Do a video show I open the door to my own house? Does this speaks well of how your IT side handles customers information security since GetGo requires additional selfie or in-person video call (as per what GetGo has in your terms and conditions page)? Want me try GetGo again? Removed my old number from GetGo and put my new number in and I will consider, else forget it! You know who I am since you reply to this complaint or just go ask Brylee. With my complaint, GetGo still thinks this is not from the owner? Grow a brain or something and think about it!

I have very good experience with GetGo since day 1 of using this app. 

Signed up via SingPass verification and the whole process to start driving is very easy.

The cars which I have rented are quite good and no issues at all. Cleanliness is like not so good as people dirty the car with tissues and receipts or some other rubbish. Overall, I would think it is still ok as I do not see any cockroaches during night rentals.

Customer service is very good too during the rental period. The response is quite fast (about 5 minutes to 10 minutes). I accidentally pressed ‚ÄúEnd Session‚Äù when I was trying to unlock the car. The customer service officer helped to continue my rental period and I was able to unlock the car. 

All the above goodness comes to an end when I contacted GetGo to update my new mobile number. 

I was told to email GetGo from MY REGISTERED EMAIL ADDRESS under my GetGo account. Provide my FULL NAME, LAST 4 DIGITS OF MY NRIC, THE CURRENT REGISTERED MOBILE NUMBER and my new mobile number.

I have updated all government agencies with my new mobile number without any issues and most of them requires a verification text message to verify I own the new mobile number.

I was shocked at what GetGo requested for a mobile number change when the customer service BryLee replied. A selfie of me holding my driving license! This is on top of a copy of my driving license front/back! Why would GetGo wants a selfie for a change of mobile number? This is absolutely absurd to begin with!

The reason given -> ‚ÄúThis is to avoid theft and deters fraudulent users from using our services.‚Äù 

I am using my registered email, provided my last 4 digits of nric, my full name and current registered phone number to request for a mobile number change! GetGo wants a selfie of me holding my driving license to prove I am who I am?! Do I need to hang a cardboard with my full name written on it too?

New and existing customers please beware that GetGo‚Äôs T&C are clearly protecting them from infringement of PDPA. This is why for a change of mobile number, GetGo dare to ask a selfie of you holding the driving license.

I do not see the need to provide a selfie holding my driving license just to prove who I am. I am able to send GetGo a copy of my driving license via my registered email address and provide them with my personal information but that is not enough for GetGo! 

If I have to change my address, do I need to attend video interview with GetGo or do a TikTok video to prove my identity?

I strongly urge all new customers and existing customers to never change mobile number or address as you will be subjected to such absurd requests from GetGo. Do note that GetGo‚Äôs T&C allows them to use your information from in-car cam to photos you submitted for their own use. Be it publicly or internal use. If you sign up agreeing without reading, you will be shock with how they can use your personal information. 

I can only see that the selfie, video interview or anything showing your face is for their customer service ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù, not for verification of identity. 

GetGo should spend more time on investigating customers who do not hold a real driving license driving GetGo‚Äôs cars. They are practically new learners driving on expressways in the middle lane at 60km/h speed! These users used someone‚Äôs accounts to rent a car for their own ‚Äúpractices‚Äù on the real roads. 

Some users of GetGo‚Äôs cars are using it as ‚ÄúGrab‚Äù cars, just check the time slots these people rent and on the frequency of how many days per week. They usually used it for night part time GrabCar jobs. 

Why the above are not priority for GetGo to block out the loopholes when people are abusing it? Instead, getting customers‚Äô selfies/video interviews for a change of mobile phone or address is a more ‚Äúefficient‚Äù way to prove one‚Äôs identity? Think about it people.",1,True,Beware of GetGo‚Äôs PDPA Exploitation,Kiyagami
